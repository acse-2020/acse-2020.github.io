# ACSE 4: Applying Computational Science

_Module Lead_: Prof. Gareth Collins

_Staff_: Prof. Gareth Collins; Prof. Stephen Neethling; Dr. James Percival; Dr. Lluis Guasch;

## Course Description

The module will be comprised of three applied computational science group projects. Each project will run for a full working week (Monday-Friday). Each project will begin with a seminar session that will consist of a lecture outlining the topic area and specifying the project tasks. The students will then be divided into a number of small groups. Teaching staff will be available during the week to answer questions and advise groups about the project.

Each assignment in the series requires a synthesis of the material covered in taught modules of the course. This helps the students to develop the skills required for problem solving with software, along with an understanding of best practice for software development and application in computational science.

Each group will then be given a week to develop their solution. The final deliverable will include the submission of software, as well as a technical report and/or oral group presentation.

## Project schedule:
- Project 1: 11-15 January 2021
