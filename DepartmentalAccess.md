# ACSE Students Seeking Permission to Access Department of Earth Science and Engineering

[Imperial's COVID Code of Conduct](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/safety/safety-by-topic/laboratory-safety/biological-safety/covid-19-guidance/keeping-you-safe---general-advice-for-everyone/imperials-code-of-conduct-attending-college-during-covid-19/) states that everybody, including students ought to 'avoid unnecessary travel to and around campuses - only visit our campuses to attend scheduled activities and follow prescribed routes'. 
 
### Department of Earth Science and Engineering (ESE)

 It is expected that taught students will come to the Department of Earth Science and Engineering only if they have scheduled face-to-face teaching. Students will be informed about any scheduled on-campus activities. For students with exceptional personal circumstances permission can be sought to work and study on campus, within the department.
 
### Permission to access ESE in exceptional circumstances 

Students from ESE (including who believe they require access because of their exceptional circumstances should fill in [this form](https://imperial.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eMdNJFUdeLIOgGV). We aim to assess requests on a fortnightly basis by the Senior Tutors. All requests for access are treated with strict confidence. Students might be asked to discuss their requests with their Senior Tutor or provide supporting evidence. Students will be informed whether access has been granted or not by their Senior Tutor, Gareth Roberts. College webpages provide guidance on working safely on campus.
 
### Reasons for seeking access

There are a number of reasons why access might be sought, including difficult remote working environments or health concerns. Technical (e.g. computing, internet access) challenges are unlikely to be considered good reasons to grant access to ESE in most circumstances. Support to address such technical challenges is provided by the Department and College, and we will refer you to appropriate support.
 
We aim to give all students who need to access ESE the opportunity to do so safely. We must work within College and government guidelines on social distancing and safe working, which means that we have strict limits on occupancy throughout College. We request that students seek permission to access the department only if necessary. Access might be limited at times because of changes to College or government guidance, and students are advised to work on the basis that access could be curtailed at short notice. If access is no longer required you must inform your Senior Tutor. A College ID card is required to access the department.   If you need any further help or advice please do speak to your tutors.
