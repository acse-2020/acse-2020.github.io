# ACSE 9: Independent Research Project

_Module Lead_: Dr. Adriana Paluszny

_Staff_: All staff

## Course Description

This module involves each student in the independent analysis of a technical problem for which they will devise, implement, test, modify, validate and document a practical computational solution.  A range of such problems will be provided to students who may opt to solve one of these, to solve a problem of their own devising, or to undertake a computational project as part of an external industry placement.  Self-devised and external projects will require the agreement of the project leader.  

Professional computational projects are seldom performed in isolation.  Consequently, students may use whatever resources they can discover to assist in their project, but must declare their use of such resources in full within a declaration accompanying their final report.
  
Students will submit a technical report in the form of a users’ and a developers’ guide to their software, and that contains the necessary technical background required to understand the initial problem, and the methods used to solve that problem, together with appropriate test and validation results.
