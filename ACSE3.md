# ACSE 3: Numerical Methods

_Module Lead_: Prof. Matthew Piggott

_Staff_: Prof. Matthew Piggott; 

## Course Description

This module will operate at the interface of the Modelling Dynamical Processes module (ACSE-2) introducing key physics and mathematical underpinning, i.e. the continuous world, and the Modern Programming Methods module (ACSE-1) for how to interact with computers. It will also provide knowledge of key algorithms that will be used in Applying Computational Science (ACSE-4).
This module will introduce the key concepts and algorithms required to represent the continuous world on discrete computers. Introductory fundamental concepts that are common across all numerical methods will be introduced: stability, accuracy, consistency, convergence, boundedness, conservation, etc.

Algorithms from numerical linear algebra and for the numerical solution of ODEs (implicit and explicit) and PDEs will be introduced. These will be motivated by the physical problems introduced in ACSE-2, and looking ahead to future modules (and their associated coursework) as well as the major projects (module ACSE-9).
