# ACSE 7: Inversion and Optimization

_Module Lead_: Mr. Stephan Kramer

_Staff_: Mr. Stephan Kramer; Prof. Matthew Piggott;

## Course Description

The main aim of this module is to introduce the methods that can be used to extract useful information from incomplete, inconsistent and inaccurate physical datasets using practical computational resources.

The following topics will be covered:
- Forward and inverse problems
- Incomplete, inconsistent and inadequate data
- Linear & non-linear problems
- Square linear systems
- Over-determined problems – least squares
- Under-determined problems – minimum norm
- Mixed-determined systems – generalised inverse
- Regularisation, constraints and penalties
- Linearised non-linear problems
- Gradient descent, conjugate gradient, higher-order methods
- Practical solutions for large systems
- Global inversion methods
- Full-waveform inversion
- Linear filters
